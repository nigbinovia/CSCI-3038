# CSCI-3038
This repository includes all the assignments I completed in CSCI 3038 - Computer Languages: Python

The following directories include:

project 1 - This program implements a console-based Minesweeper game. It randomly places mines on a 9x9 grid and allows users to uncover cells without hitting mines. Users input coordinates to make moves, and the program reveals adjacent mine counts using recursive logic. The game continues until the user either wins or uncovers a mine, displaying victory or defeat messages accordingly.

project 2 - This program defines three classes for a card game: `Card`, `Deck`, and `Hand`.Then, the `main()` function demonstrates these classes by simulating interactions like drawing, shuffling, and managing a player's hand.

project 3 - This program is a simplified text-based implementation of a blackjack game. The player is dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" or "stand." If the player's hand exceeds 21 points, they lose. Otherwise, the dealer draws cards until their hand's score is at least 17. The winner is determined by comparing the scores, with the one closer to 21 winning.

project 4 - This program creates a GUI window that allows users to input a URL, choose how they want the content displayed, and then scrape and show the content accordingly. First, 

project 5 - This program scrapes song titles from HTML content of provided URLs, searches for the corresponding tracks on Spotify, and adds those tracks to a user's playlist using the Spotipy library.
